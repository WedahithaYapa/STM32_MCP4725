# STM32_MCP4725
I have made a simple library for MCP4725 from STM32 . I have used this code for STM32 F746ZG board. You can Change the I2C pins simply and the code will work for any board. I have only developed for the Fast Write I can upload for others as well if needed.  I will do it if people need it.
